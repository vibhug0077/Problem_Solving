---

## 1. **Symmetry in Problem Solving**

### üîπ Definition

Symmetry is the idea that certain problems or objects remain unchanged (invariant) under specific transformations (reflection, rotation, exchange of variables). Recognizing symmetry often **simplifies complex problems**.

### üîπ Types of Symmetry

#### a) **Geometric Symmetry**

* When a figure or shape remains unchanged under reflection, rotation, or translation.
* **Example:**

  * A square has 4 lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 4.
  * In geometry problems, symmetry often reduces computation (e.g., finding distances in regular polygons).

#### b) **Algebraic Symmetry**

* When an algebraic expression or equation remains unchanged after interchanging variables or applying transformations.
* **Example:**

  * The expression $x^2 + y^2$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$.
  * The system $x + y = 10, xy = 21$ can be solved by recognizing symmetry and using Vieta‚Äôs formulas.

### üîπ Symmetry as a Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Reduce Complexity** ‚Äì By treating symmetric cases as identical.
2. **Avoid Redundancy** ‚Äì Solve one case and extend results by symmetry.
3. **Exploit Balance** ‚Äì In optimization, symmetric solutions are often optimal.

**Example Problem:**
Place 3 equal charges at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Find the net force on one charge.

* By symmetry ‚Üí resultant force direction is along the angle bisector.
* Simplifies vector addition without messy calculations.

## 2. **The Extreme Principle**

### üîπ Definition

The Extreme Principle is a heuristic where one solves a problem by considering the **largest, smallest, or most extreme element** in the situation. It is based on the idea:

> ‚ÄúLook at the extreme case ‚Äî it often reveals the structure of the problem.‚Äù

### üîπ Key Applications

1. **Optimization Problems**

   * Finding maximum/minimum values.
   * Example: Maximize area of rectangle inscribed in a circle.

2. **Contradiction Proofs**

   * Assume a solution exists, then examine the extreme case to derive contradiction.
   * Example: In a set of points, choose the farthest apart to reason about distances.

3. **Discrete Mathematics & Number Theory**

   * Pick the smallest/largest number to reason about properties.
   * Example: Prove that any set of natural numbers has a least element (Well-Ordering Principle).

4. **Graph Theory/Combinatorics**

   * Select vertex with maximum/minimum degree to argue structure.
   * Example: In proving properties of trees, often start with a leaf (degree 1).

### üîπ Example Problem

**Problem:** In a group of people, each shakes hands with exactly 3 others. Prove the number of people is even.

* **Extreme Principle approach:** Consider the person with the ‚Äúlowest index‚Äù or extreme case, build connections, and use parity arguments.

## 3. **Comparison of Symmetry and Extreme Principle**

| Aspect      | Symmetry                           | Extreme Principle                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Nature**  | Balance, invariance, equality      | Focus on extremes (max/min)                |
| **Domain**  | Geometry, algebra, physics         | Combinatorics, number theory, optimization |
| **Use**     | Simplifies by reducing cases       | Simplifies by focusing on boundary case    |
| **Example** | Equilateral triangle force balance | Smallest number argument in number theory  |

## 4. **Summary**

* **Symmetry** (geometric & algebraic) exploits balance and invariance to simplify problems.
* **Extreme Principle** focuses on maximum/minimum elements to gain insights or prove results.
* Both are **powerful heuristics** in mathematics and logical reasoning, often used in competitions and advanced problem-solving.

‚úÖ **In short:**

* Symmetry = *‚ÄúExploit balance and invariance.‚Äù*
* Extreme Principle = *‚ÄúExamine the largest/smallest case for insight.‚Äù*
