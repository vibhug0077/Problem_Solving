# üìò Problem Classification

## 1. **Based on Routine vs Non-Routine**

* **Routine Problems (Exercises):**

  * Standard, familiar tasks with clear solution methods.
  * Require application of known formulas/algorithms.
  * Example: Solving $2x + 5 = 15$.

* **Non-Routine Problems (True Problems):**

  * No obvious solution path; requires strategy and creativity.
  * Multiple approaches or answers possible.
  * Example: ‚ÄúDesign an efficient water distribution system for a village.‚Äù

---

## 2. **Based on Structure**

* **Well-Defined Problems:**

  * Clear initial state, goal state, and rules.
  * Only one correct answer.
  * Example: Solving a crossword puzzle, algebra equation.

* **Ill-Defined Problems:**

  * Ambiguous, with incomplete information.
  * May have multiple solutions.
  * Example: Planning a city‚Äôs transportation system.

---

## 3. **Based on Domain**

* **Mathematical Problems:**
  Require symbolic/quantitative reasoning (e.g., geometry, algebra).

* **Scientific Problems:**
  Involve experiments, hypotheses, and cause-effect reasoning.

* **Engineering/Technical Problems:**
  Focus on design, optimization, and practical implementation.

* **Management/Decision-Making Problems:**
  Concern choices under constraints, risk, and uncertainty.

* **Everyday Life Problems:**
  Practical challenges (budgeting, planning a trip, conflict resolution).

---

## 4. **Based on Complexity**

* **Simple Problems:**

  * Few variables and straightforward solution.
  * Example: ‚ÄúWhat is 20% of 150?‚Äù

* **Complex Problems:**

  * Multiple interdependent factors, requires systems thinking.
  * Example: Climate change mitigation, economic planning.

---

## 5. **Based on Solution Process**

* **Algorithmic Problems:**

  * Solvable through step-by-step procedures.
  * Example: Long division, computer sorting algorithm.

* **Heuristic Problems:**

  * Require trial-and-error, intuition, or shortcuts.
  * Example: Navigating an unknown city without GPS.

---

## 6. **Based on Time & Context**

* **Convergent Problems:**

  * Single best solution.
  * Example: Solve for $x$ in a quadratic equation.

* **Divergent Problems:**

  * Encourage multiple possible solutions.
  * Example: ‚ÄúList as many uses as you can for a paperclip.‚Äù

---

## 7. **Educational Psychology Classification**

(Adapted from Polya‚Äôs and Bloom‚Äôs frameworks)

* **Knowledge-based Problems** (recall, recognition).
* **Application Problems** (apply rules in familiar settings).
* **Analytical Problems** (break down and examine parts).
* **Creative Problems** (generate new approaches/ideas).
* **Evaluative Problems** (judge solutions for efficiency/validity).

| **Solution Process**       | Algorithmic, Heuristic                                   | Long division vs Navigation            |
| **Context**                | Convergent, Divergent                                    | Equation solving vs Brainstorming      |
| **Education Level**        | Knowledge, Application, Analysis, Creativity, Evaluation | Fact recall vs Innovation              |

‚úÖ **In short:**

* Problems vary by **structure (well/ill-defined)**, **nature (routine/non-routine)**, **domain (math, science, real life)**, and **complexity (simple/complex)**.
* Understanding classifications helps in **teaching problem-solving strategies**, **designing curriculum**, and **real-world decision-making**.
