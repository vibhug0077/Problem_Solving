# 📘 Cognitive Problem-Solving, Functional Fixedness, and Mental Set

---

## 1. **Cognitive Problem-Solving**

### 🔹 Definition

Cognitive problem-solving refers to the **mental processes** involved in identifying, analyzing, and resolving problems. It focuses on how people **perceive, represent, and manipulate information** to reach solutions.

### 🔹 Key Stages (from cognitive psychology):

1. **Problem Representation** – understanding and mentally organizing the problem.
2. **Strategy Formation** – choosing methods (algorithms, heuristics).
3. **Information Organization** – structuring data (tables, diagrams, categories).
4. **Resource Allocation** – deciding how much effort/time to spend.
5. **Monitoring** – checking progress and adjusting strategies.
6. **Evaluation** – judging solution effectiveness and efficiency.

### 🔹 Example

* Solving a riddle like: *“A man has to get a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river…”* requires:

  * **Representation** (understand constraints).
  * **Strategy** (trial and error, heuristics).
  * **Evaluation** (ensure all are safely across).

## 2. **Functional Fixedness**

### 🔹 Definition

Functional fixedness is a **cognitive bias** where people become stuck on using an object **only in its traditional way**, preventing them from seeing alternative uses.

### 🔹 Example

* The **Candle Problem (Duncker, 1945):**

  * Participants are given a candle, box of tacks, and matches.
  * Task: Fix the candle to the wall so it doesn’t drip on the table.
  * Many fail because they see the box only as a container, not as a platform.
  * Solution: Tack the box to the wall and place the candle inside.

### 🔹 Real-Life Example

* Seeing a screwdriver only as a tool for screws, not as a lever or weight.
* In emergencies, functional fixedness may block creative solutions.

## 3. **Mental Set**

### 🔹 Definition

Mental set is the tendency to **approach new problems using strategies that worked in the past**, even if better solutions exist. It reflects a kind of cognitive rigidity.

### 🔹 Example

* **Luchins’ Water Jar Problem (1942):**

  * Participants are given several problems involving measuring water using jars of different sizes.
  * After solving a few with a complex method, many persist in using it, even when a much simpler method is available.

### 🔹 Real-Life Example

* A manager always uses the same marketing strategy because it worked before, ignoring new digital approaches that may be cheaper and more effective.

## 4. **Relationship Between Them**

* **Functional Fixedness** = being stuck on **object use**.
* **Mental Set** = being stuck on **strategy/method use**.
* Both are **cognitive barriers** that limit flexibility, creativity, and innovation in problem solving.

---

## 5. **Overcoming These Barriers**

* **Encourage divergent thinking:** Brainstorm multiple uses/solutions.
* **Reframe the problem:** Look from different perspectives.
* **Use analogies:** Apply insights from unrelated fields.
* **Practice cognitive flexibility:** Engage in puzzles, creativity exercises.

| Concept                       | Definition                                          | Classic Example       | Real-Life Example                   | Barrier Type            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Cognitive Problem-Solving** | Mental processes for analyzing & resolving problems | River crossing puzzle | Business decision-making            | Neutral (process)       |
| **Functional Fixedness**      | Stuck on traditional object use                     | Candle problem        | Screwdriver as only tool for screws | Object-based rigidity   |
| **Mental Set**                | Relying on old methods despite new options          | Water jar problem     | Manager using outdated marketing    | Strategy-based rigidity |

✅ **In short:**

* **Cognitive problem-solving** explains how we mentally process problems.
* **Functional fixedness** limits us to traditional uses of objects.
* **Mental set** limits us to familiar strategies, even when better ones exist.
* Both hinder **creative and flexible problem-solving**.
